## Install

Inside a Claude Code instance, run the following commands:

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**
```
/plugin marketplace add jarrodwatts/claude-delegator
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**
```
/plugin install claude-delegator
```

**Step 3: Run setup**
```
/claude-delegator:setup
```

Done! Claude now routes complex tasks to GPT, Gemini, and Copilot experts automatically.

> **Note**: Requires at least one of [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli), or [Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot). Setup guides you through installation.

## What is Claude Delegator?

Claude gains a team of specialists via native MCP — GPT and Claude models via Codex/Copilot, plus Gemini. Each expert has a distinct specialty and can advise OR implement.

**Note:** You can use any provider (GPT via Codex, GPT/Claude via Copilot, or Gemini), or multiple. The plugin will automatically detect which ones are configured and route tasks accordingly.

| What You Get | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **5 domain experts** | Right specialist for each problem type |
| **GPT, Claude, or Gemini** | Use your preferred model provider (Codex, Copilot, or Gemini) |
| **Dual mode** | Experts can analyze (read-only) or implement (write) |
| **Auto-routing** | Claude detects when to delegate based on your request |
| **Synthesized responses** | Claude interprets expert output, never raw passthrough |

### The Experts

| Expert | What They Do | Example Triggers |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Architect** | System design, tradeoffs, complex debugging | "How should I structure this?" / "What are the tradeoffs?" |
| **Plan Reviewer** | Validate plans before you start | "Review this migration plan" / "Is this approach sound?" |
| **Scope Analyst** | Catch ambiguities early | "What am I missing?" / "Clarify the scope" |
| **Code Reviewer** | Find bugs, improve quality | "Review this PR" / "What's wrong with this?" |
| **Security Analyst** | Vulnerabilities, threat modeling | "Is this secure?" / "Harden this endpoint" |

### When Experts Help Most

- **Architecture decisions** — "Should I use Redis or in-memory caching?"
- **Stuck debugging** — After 2+ failed attempts, get a fresh perspective
- **Pre-implementation** — Validate your plan before writing code
- **Security concerns** — "Is this auth flow safe?"
- **Code quality** — Get a second opinion on your implementation

### When NOT to Use Experts

- Simple file operations (Claude handles these directly)
- First attempt at any fix (try yourself first)
- Trivial questions (no need to delegate)

## How It Works

```
You: "Is this authentication flow secure?"
                    ↓
Claude: [Detects security question → selects Security Analyst]
                    ↓
        ┌───────────────────────────────┐
        │  mcp__codex__codex            │
        │  (or mcp__gemini__gemini)     │
        │  (or mcp__copilot__copilot)   │
        │  → Security Analyst prompt    │
        │  → Expert analyzes your code  │
        └───────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
Claude: "Based on the analysis, I found 3 issues..."
        [Synthesizes response, applies judgment]
```

**Key details:**
- Each expert has a specialized system prompt (in `prompts/`)
- Claude reads your request → picks the right expert → delegates via MCP (GPT or Gemini)
- Responses are synthesized, not passed through raw
- Experts can retry up to 3 times before escalating
- Multi-turn conversations preserve context via `threadId` for chained tasks

### Multi-Turn Conversations

For chained implementation steps, the expert preserves context across turns:

```
Turn 1: mcp__*__* → returns threadId
Turn 2: mcp__*__*-reply(threadId) → expert remembers turn 1
Turn 3: mcp__*__*-reply(threadId) → expert remembers turns 1-2
```

Use single-shot (`codex`, `gemini`, or `copilot` only) for advisory tasks. Use multi-turn for implementation chains and retries.

---

## Configuration

### Operating Modes

Every expert supports two modes based on the task:

| Mode | Sandbox | Use When |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Advisory** | `read-only` | Analysis, recommendations, reviews |
| **Implementation** | `workspace-write` | Making changes, fixing issues |

Claude automatically selects the mode based on your request.

### Configuration Defaults

Set global defaults in `~/.codex/config.toml` instead of passing parameters on every call:

```toml
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
approval_policy = "on-failure"
```

Per-call parameters override these defaults. See [Codex CLI docs](https://github.com/openai/codex) for all config options.

### Manual MCP Setup

If `/setup` doesn't work, register the MCP server(s) manually:

```bash
# For Codex (GPT)
# Idempotent: safe to rerun
claude mcp remove codex >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user codex -- codex -m gpt-5.3-codex mcp-server

# For Gemini
# Idempotent: safe to rerun
claude mcp remove gemini >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user gemini -- node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/server/gemini/index.js

# For Copilot (GPT)
# Idempotent: safe to rerun
claude mcp remove copilot >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user copilot -- node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/server/copilot/index.js
```

Verify with:

```bash
claude mcp list
printf '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"health","method":"initialize","params":{}}\n' | node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/server/gemini/index.js
printf '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"health","method":"initialize","params":{}}\n' | node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/server/copilot/index.js
```

### Customizing Expert Prompts

Expert prompts live in `prompts/`. Each follows the same structure:
- Role definition and context
- Advisory vs Implementation modes
- Response format guidelines
- When to invoke / when NOT to invoke

Edit these to customize expert behavior for your workflow.

## Requirements

You need at least one of the following providers configured:

- **Codex CLI** (for GPT): `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- **Gemini CLI** (for Gemini): `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`
- **Copilot CLI** (for GPT and Claude models): `npm install -g @github/copilot`

**Authentication**:
- Codex: run `codex login`
- Gemini: run `gemini` once and complete the sign-in flow (or set `GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
- Copilot: run `copilot login`


---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/claude-delegator:setup` | Configure MCP server and install rules |
| `/claude-delegator:uninstall` | Remove MCP config and rules |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| MCP server not found | Restart Claude Code after setup |
| Provider not authenticated | Codex: run `codex login`. Gemini: run `gemini` once to complete sign-in (or set `GOOGLE_API_KEY`). Copilot: run `copilot login` |
| Tool not appearing | Run `claude mcp list` and verify registration |
| Expert not triggered | Try explicit: "Ask GPT to review...", "Ask Gemini to review...", or "Ask Copilot to review..." |
